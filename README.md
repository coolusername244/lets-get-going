# Welcome to Lets Get Going

### What is 'Lets Get Going' about?

Within this repository, you will see the first project we have created using GitHub

This document contains 3 pages, each showing you what skills we have been learning and what is still to come.

The 3 pages are split into:

1. Stream One
2. Stream Two
3. Stream Three

I invite you to take a look and see what it is we will be learning in the coming months.

What I encourage you to do is *click* on any of the *links* or *images* and have a read through the different programmes we are all excited to learn.
